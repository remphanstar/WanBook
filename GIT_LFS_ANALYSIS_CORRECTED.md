# Updated Git LFS Analysis - Most Files Don't Need LFS!

## ✅ Corrected Analysis

After checking the actual `deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP` repository structure, **most files do NOT need Git LFS**:

### What's Actually in the Repository

#### LoRA Directories (Just READMEs)
- `loras_hunyuan/Readme.txt` (21 bytes)
- `loras_hunyuan_i2v/Readme.txt` 
- `loras_ltxv/Readme.txt` (15 bytes)
- These contain instructions for downloading LoRAs, not the actual model files

#### Main Implementation (Python Code)
- `wgp.py` (331KB) - Main application
- `i2v_inference.py` (23KB) - Image-to-video inference
- `requirements.txt` (590 bytes)
- Various Python modules in subdirectories

#### Preprocessing (Python Code)
- `preprocessing/flow.py`, `gray.py`, `scribble.py`
- Subdirectories with Python implementations
- No large model files - just code

### Files That CAN Be Uploaded Normally
```
✅ ALL Python files (*.py)
✅ Configuration files (*.yaml, *.json) 
✅ Documentation (*.md, *.txt)
✅ Requirements files
✅ Most assets (images, small files)
```

### Files That May Need Git LFS (If They Exist)
```
❓ Large model files (if user has downloaded any locally)
❓ Large video files in assets/
❓ Cached model weights (if any exist locally)
```

## Simplified Upload Strategy

Since the repository is mostly Python code:

1. **Upload everything normally** - no Git LFS needed for 90%+ of files
2. **Only use Git LFS** for any large files the user may have added locally
3. **Much simpler process** than originally anticipated

## Updated Upload Script

The PowerShell script can upload almost everything without skipping files for Git LFS!

**Key Learning**: Always check the actual repository structure before making assumptions about file sizes and Git LFS requirements. The original Wan2GP repo is mostly source code, not large model files.
