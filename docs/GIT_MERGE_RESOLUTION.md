# Git Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

## Current Situation
VS Code is showing: "Can't push refs to remote. Try running 'Pull' first to integrate your changes."

**Root Cause:** Your local `main` branch has diverged from `origin/main`
- Local: ahead 9 commits  
- Remote: ahead 220 commits  
- Git requires integration before pushing

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Force Push (Destructive - Not Recommended)
```powershell
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
⚠️ **WARNING:** This will overwrite remote history with your local changes

### Option 2: Pull with Merge Strategy (Recommended)
```powershell
# Pull and allow unrelated histories to merge
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin main

# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
# Then commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge remote changes with local workspace"

# Push the merged result
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Rebase Strategy (Advanced)
```powershell
# Rebase your local commits on top of remote
git pull --rebase --allow-unrelated-histories origin main

# Resolve conflicts during rebase if needed
# Push when complete
git push origin main
```

## What Each Option Does

### Force Push
- ✅ Simple and immediate
- ❌ **DESTROYS** all remote commits (220 commits lost!)
- ❌ Other contributors lose their work
- ❌ Not reversible

### Pull + Merge
- ✅ Preserves all history (local + remote)
- ✅ Safe - no data loss
- ✅ Creates merge commit showing integration
- ⚠️ May require conflict resolution

### Rebase
- ✅ Clean linear history
- ✅ Preserves all commits
- ⚠️ More complex conflict resolution
- ⚠️ Changes commit hashes

## Recommended Action

Since this is a project cleanup/reorganization, **Option 2 (Pull + Merge)** is safest:

1. **Pull with merge** to integrate both histories
2. **Resolve conflicts** by choosing your local versions
3. **Commit the merge** with clear message
4. **Push the result** containing both histories

This preserves all work while establishing your current workspace as the active state.

## Next Steps

Choose your preferred approach and execute the commands. The pull operation will likely require conflict resolution since you've reorganized the project structure significantly.
