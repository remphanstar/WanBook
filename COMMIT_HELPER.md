# Current Commit Status - Notebook Formatting Updates

## What Just Happened
- Successfully reformatted WanBook.ipynb with proper Colab cell structure
- Fixed the repository management cell (Cell 4) with proper `action` variable initialization
- Updated all cell titles to use `#@title` format with `{ display-mode: "form" }`
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with new formatting improvements

## Current VS Code Status
VS Code shows: "Can't push refs to remote. Try running 'Pull' first to integrate your changes."

# Git Push Resolution Steps

## Current Status
✅ **Commit successful**: `feat: improve notebook formatting and fix repository management`  
❌ **Push rejected**: Remote has newer commits (non-fast-forward)

## Solution: Pull and Merge

Run these commands in sequence:

```powershell
# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts after notebook formatting updates"

# Push the merged result
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (Use with caution)
If you're sure your local changes should override remote:

```powershell
git push origin main --force
```

## What This Will Do
1. **Pull**: Downloads latest remote commits
2. **Auto-merge**: Git will try to automatically merge changes
3. **Manual resolve**: If conflicts occur, edit files and commit
4. **Push**: Upload your merged changes

## Expected Result
After successful pull and push:
- Your notebook formatting improvements will be in the repository
- Remote commits will be preserved
- VS Code Source Control will show clean state

## The Credential Warning
The `git: 'credential-manager-core' is not a git command` warning is harmless - your credentials are working fine (notice "Everything up-to-date" before the rejection).

## Files in This Commit
- COMMIT_HELPER.md (this helper file)

## Next Steps
After successful push:
1. Verify changes in GitHub repository
2. Test the updated notebook in Colab
3. Confirm Cell 4 no longer has the UnboundLocalError
4. Delete this helper file if desired
